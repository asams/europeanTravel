Hello there.  Thanks for cloning our Europeann TravelGuide repository!
This project is a smaller version of our TravelGuide project, using
MongoDB instead of MySQL.

To install the database, use mongoimport on the countries.csv, cities.csv, 
comments.csv, and city_comments.csv files in your mongodb bin file, or use 
mongorestore with the dump file.

We hope you enjoy our European TravelGuide!
